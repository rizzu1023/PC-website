                                  Socio technology helps people, especially those who are technically sound, in contributing their share towards the society with the skills they have. It allows an individual to share, feel included, feel inspired, and be recognized for their contributions. It also allows companies to accelerate their end-to-end innovation process, make it repeatable and measure the real business value. Socio technology merges social issues with the technology and generate a solution over the problem. While introducing the concept of socio technology in our technical event ALGORITHM, we try to enlighten young programmers about the real time crises of our society and motivate them to turn up with an optimal solution as a step from their side towards serving good to the people.

                                    In an information-rich era, the traditional traffic surveillance and control methods are confronted with great challenges. Traffic congestion is caused by multiple reasons such as too many cars for the roadway, inadequate mass transit options, road work, accidents, narrow roads or other reasons. Traffic system signals out of sync many times on purpose or occasionally when the computers are malfunctioning. The problem of Traffic Congestion needs to be fixed.

                                    Education is the fastest growing service industry in the globe which needs appropriate methods and strategies to meet the current students' needs, keep them happy, and attract more recruitments. Perhaps the most apparent failure of our education system is that after completing graduation in any discipline, students are not able to get jobs. It is simply because the skills required for a position in a candidate are not inculcated in the students which makes them loose their eligibility. The syllabus still consists of topics that are too outdated for the market, and the whole focus is on cramming information rather than understanding and analyzing it. Students need to stay updated over market concerns and emerging technologies which they majorly fail at. This is one of the major concerns that we need to deal with.

                                    In the modern society, there is an ever-increasing number of vehicles. This is leading to problems such as large urban parking lots becoming inefficient, increasing difficulty to find open spaces in busy parking lots, as well as the increasing need to devote larger areas of land for additional parking spaces. With families getting smaller and the total number of motor vehicles exceeding the total number of heads per family, the parking scenario is woefully falling short of the current requirements in the country. The situation is such that on any given working day, approximately 40% of the roads in urban Mumbai are taken up for just parking the cars. Hence, it is predicted that smart parking systems will play an important role in the transport field in terms of environment impact on climate change and commuter’s savings and time management.

                                   With crowded halls, provider shortages and sloppy patient hand-off, Hospitals are the second most energy-intensive buildings after restaurants, and globally, healthcare costs are on the rise. These financial challenges — in addition to an aging world population and increasing energy costs—are putting pressure on healthcare organizations to do more with less without compromising quality of care. With having done with these problems, the major issue faced by a common man today is unavailability of blood in the blood banks. Many blood banks in India still lack the needed facilities to make blood components and thus most of them issue whole blood; thus, contributing to the shortage of blood and unnecessarily overburdening the patient cause harm at times, as blood transfusion reactions are more common. According to an article published in Times of India, in the last five years, over 2.8 million precious units of blood and its components were discarded by blood banks across the country, exposing serious loopholes in the nation's blood banking system.

                                Child abuse and neglect is well established as an important societal concern with significant ramifications for the affected children, their families, and society at large. A critical step in devising effective responses is reasonable agreement on the definition of the problem and its scope. Yet achieving clarity in the area of child abuse and neglect has been an ongoing challenge. There is a rise in child abduction and molestation. Besides, areas are concerned with limiting children's exposure to hazards and reducing children's risk of harm. Children are particularly vulnerable to accidents, and their safety requires different approaches from those for adults. There is a need for an application that ensure children safety.

                                    Safety of women matters a lot whether at home, outside the home or working place. Last few crimes against women were very dreadful and fearful. It is said that Women’s safety in India has a long way to go. Mumbai is one of the major hubs where women safety is a growing concern and it won’t be a great city till every girl child, in every corner feels safe and can walk fearlessly, even at night. We chant a thousand slogans and take pledges to protect the dignity of our women but that never works. Our actions need to speak louder than the words.

                                    Getting Government permissions over something creates lot of havoc in Mumbai. People have to follow dozens of rules and undergo long procedures that people find really tiresome and waste of time. A digital solution can help Mumbaikars get permissions more feasibly from the Government Officers with features like Aadhar linked system for document submission, etc.

                                    Every year, millions of people come to Mumbai in search of jobs, education, etc. Mumbai being the financial capital of India, people travel across different places within the city. Also, Mumbai, being one of the favourite Tourism destinations lacks one thing : A PROPER GUIDE. Most of the tourists who visit our city donot rely on a guide due to lack of faith and confidence. Hence, we need to have a system to efficiently eliminate the need of a local guide.

                                    This is one of the major problems in governance that people choose to ignore. Every year, Government introduces hundreds of welfare schemes and scholarships to encourage education participation, welfare of a common man or provide assistance to people who fall below the poverty line, etc. Hence, there is a need for identification of eligible beneficiaries of various Government welfare schemes, make them aware on timely basis and let them utilize it. These schemes are under-used as people are not aware about them. This problem needs to be fixed.
