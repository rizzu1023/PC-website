            <p>Socio technology helps people, especially those who are technically sound, in contributing their share towards the society with the skills they have. It lets humans share, feel included, feel inspired, and be recognized for their contributions.  It also allows companies to accelerate their end-to-end innovation process, make it repeatable and measure the real business value.</p>
            <p>Socio technology merges social issues with the technology and generate a solution over the problem.While introducing the concept of socio technology in the our technical event ALGORITHM, we try to enlighten young programmers about the real time crises of our society and motivate them to turn up with an optimal solution as a step from their side towards serving good to the people.</p>
            <p>A man's life is normally divided into five main stages namely infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age. In each of these stages an individual has to find himself in different situations and face different problems. The old age is not without problems. In old age physical strength deteriorates, mental stability diminishes; money power becomes bleak coupled with negligence from the younger generation According to an estimate nearly 40% of senior citizens living with their families are reportedly facing abuse of one kind or another, but only 1 in 6 cases actually comes to light.According to NGOs incidences of elderly couples being forced to sell their houses are very high. Many of them suffer in silence as they fear humiliation or are too scared to speak up</p>
            <p>Develop an application which can solve any of social issues digitally by transforming our nation and creating opportunities for all citizens by harnessing digital technologies to empower every citizen with access to digital services, knowledge and information.</p>
