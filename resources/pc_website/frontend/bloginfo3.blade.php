           <h2>Entrepreneur Or Employee</h2>

<p>We always receive bunch of advices relating to your career. Deciding on a career path is one of the most important choice we make in our life.There is common saying,‚ÄùChoose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.But one question that gets ignored by many people is whether they want to be an entrepreneur or an employee.It's a trending debate, but does anyone knows the difference between and entrepreneur and an employee.An entrepreneur is someone who starts a new organization, a business, on the verge of implementing his ideas and skills.</p>
<p>Knowing the difference between employment and business mindset is crucial to understand which option would work better for you as an individual, and how being an employee or a business owner can suit your own personality and goals.There are pros and cons of both, so we cannot be indecisive while choosing our path.One of the major reason many people directs toward employment is 'guaranteed income'. The fixed amount of money deposited on a weekly or monthly basis into bank accounts means financial security for the employee and their family.</p>
<p>But an employee is not free to make their own decisions, working hard for his company while businessmen have other people helping them to make money and achieve their goals.Entrepreneurs have their "no" muscle often to maintain their focus on what matters. Employees, on the other hand, say "yes" to everything because they fear that if they say 'no' to an opportunity, they'll miss out on their big break.We should think whether it is better to live our own way, or be a blind bull of your master. The idea is not for harming the image of employment but to overcome the restrictions put on by the society.</p>
 <p>In a work environment, employees must show off their hard work, to achieve a promotion or pay raise, especially when they're part of a large department or company, otherwise they simply get lost in the crowd.Business encounters some loss but true entrepreneurs develop humbleness,as they don't believe that only they can do something the right way. Instead, they learn to delegate and trust the people they've hired.Keeping the views aside, the real focus is to not overthink about our actions, as all life is an experiment. At the end of the day it's not what you achieve, it's what you overcome. That's what defines your career.</p>
