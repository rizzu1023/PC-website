               <h2>Food technology</h2>
                <p>The world population is roaring toward 9 billion, our available land is shrinking, and our communities are growing more connected, leaving one increasingly important global issue hanging above our heads: food security. Fortunately, technology is allowing us to track, analyze, and understand the way our food system works to help reduce the amount of food waste and carbon emissions, and ultimately, feed the 842 million people who don't currently have enough to eat.</p>
                <p>Imagine genetically engineering your food to get the desired macro-nutrients and supplemental vitamins out of it. Well, we donâ€™t have to imagine it because humans have been tinkering with the biological activity of crops to yield maximum nutritional content, since the 90s. </p>
                <p>At the forefront of innovation in the food industry is the way we grow crops itself. Farming nowadays isn't what movies and tv have led us to believe, it is much more sophisticated than a farmer just using manual labor converts time and resources into edible crops. </p>
                <p>Modern day farmers use Precision Farming that involves satellites, GPS, weather pattern, drones etc, to ensure profitable yield while maintaining the quality of the crops.Furthermore, the idea of 3D printed food isn't exactly mouth-watering, but the technology stands to disrupt the food industry on at least some level. Right now, the most talked-about 3D printed food is basic sugar candies and on some highly sophisticated models, actual pizzas have been printed into existence. This isn't necessarily meant for the everyday working population, but this certainly receives a great deal of appreciation by various space travel agencies. Once perfected, this technology aims to eliminate the traditional approach of preserving food in order to use them in space exploratory missions.</p>
                <p>Moving from the production aspect of the food, many effective innovations have been made to aptly manage consumption. Technologically speaking consumers have readily available information about the macro-nutrient content of their food. With this level of control over the nutritional values of the food, many new and effective dietary plans have been cultivated.</p>

             <p>Anjuman-I-Islams Kalsekar Technical Camous is a growing Technical Institute which aspires to enhance its teaching, learning and research work. An institute of higher learning, merely dedicated for the global enrichment of students at the individual level to meet the diverse needs of the evolving technology and society.</p>
             <p>Just like the Institution, its Department of Computer Engineering encourages students and empowers the teaching and non-teaching staff to push their limits to exceed the global expectations through curriculum excellence, social enrichment and serve well to the people.</p>
