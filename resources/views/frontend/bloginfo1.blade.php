               <h2>wireless charging</h2>
 
             <p>In recent years smartphones have expanded their capability exponentially. It seems like new features, both software and hardware implemented are being added to smartphones in huge numbers. It’s hard to say conclusively what the hot new trend smartphone manufacturers are jumping on, given the size of the smartphone industry it seems that at least one new flagship smartphone hits the market every month. That too packed with bleeding edge tech. Some notable trends in smartphone design, particular to 2018 was the iconic “notch” display and the inclusion of multiple back cameras are just to name a few. But one thing that the entire smartphone company is striving towards is “true” wireless charging.</p>
             <p>Although it is not uncommon to see high-end smartphones equipped with “contact” wireless charging, where you place your phone on an inductive plate that uses electromagnetic field paired with inductive coupling to wirelessly charge your phone. This technology has been around since 2009. </p>
             <p>Nearly a decade ago, this was a groundbreaking achievement. But in the era of millennials, this seems an outdated and dull concept. Admittedly you do not have to use any cables, you are still tethered to a charging pad instead of a charging cable. MInor improvements by smartphone brands like Huawei has been made, where you can use one phone as a charging station for another phone just by placing one phone on top of another. This seems to be a brandish demonstration of the technology instead of practical use.</p>
             <p>“True”  wireless charging as mentioned above is the bleeding edge tech that seems to be a new trendsetter in the smartphone industry. The concept is simple, if and when you want you will be able to charge your phone or any electronic device for that matter “over the air”. The idea seems straight out of a sci-fi movie. But much to our amusement, this concept has already been worked on by several start-ups to truly transform all electronic devices in an ecosystem that ensures interoperability. It seems crazy that you can charge your electronic devices without any cables, contact or anything, except what seems like pure magic.  Just imagine, never having to deal with the trouble of your phone dying because you didn’t have your cable with you, or having your ps4 controller battery die in the middle of an epic FIFA match. In fact, many working products are already available on the market to relieve you of such cumbersome dilemma with “The MotherBox” and “Energous” to name a few.</p>
             <p>This revolutionary technology is not only limited to the smartphone industry, in fact, but it also seems to have paved its way into the automobile, automation, space travel and countless other crucial sectors of human civilization. Just to show how transforming this technology can be, many electric car manufacturing companies are already testing cars that will wirelessly charge through induction mesh paved into the road system. If this were to be actually implemented we could theoretically have cars that can run indefinitely.</p>
